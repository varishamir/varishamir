# Hi, I'm Varisha! 👋

I'm a passionate learner currently building my foundation in programming. 

## 🛠 What I'm Learning
I am currently challenging myself by learning two languages at once:
* **C++ 🔵**: Focusing on logic and how computers handle memory.
* **HTML 🟡**: Learning it, because of my interest in Web development.
